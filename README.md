# Document Management System

This little application is supposed to watch a directory where scanned documents (jpg, png and pdf) are saved to.

Upon detection of such an action the document's meta data are read and saved to a database.

Each document is flagged [INITIAL, ENRICHMENT, SAVED, ARCHIVED].

## Document status

This section described the different document status. A document status workflow is usually INITIAL -> ENRICHMENT -> SAVED -> ARCHIVED.

### INITIAL
### ENRICHMENT
### SAVED
### ARCHIVED
